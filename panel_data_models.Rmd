# Panel Data Models

- Panel data are datasets in which a set of units (for example people) are
observed for several time periods.

- If experimental data are not available, then the use of panel data is
one important approach to reduce the problem of omitted variable bias.

- There are many empirical research areas where results that are not based
on panel data are no longer taken seriously.

## Fixed Effects Model

- The fixed effects model is simply a variation on the linear regression
model.

- Its key advantage is that it enables us to control for all variables
that vary over the cross-sectional units but are constant over time.

### Example: Traffic Fatalities and Beer Tax

Dataset from Stock & Watson (Ch.10), covers state traffic fatality data available for 48 states observed over seven years (from 1982 to 1988), for a total of 336 observations. 

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)

fatality <- read_dta("./data/fatality.dta")

fatality %>%
  mutate(state = as.numeric(state)) %>% 
  left_join(maps::state.fips, by = c("state" = "fips")) %>% 
  select(state = abb, year, mrall, beertax, mlda, jaild, vmiles, unrate, perinc) %>% 
  head(n = 10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```

## Assumptions of the Fixed Effects Model

- The fixed effects model assumes that the true relationship is:

    $$\begin{aligned}
    y_{i,t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{i,t} + \beta_2z_i + u_{i,t} \end{aligned}$$
    
    where in the S&W example $y_{i,t}$ would be the number of traffic
    fatalities and $x_{i,t}$ the beer tax in state $i$ in year $t$.

- Note that the variable $z_i$ does not have a time index and is therefore
assumed to be constant over time.

- In this example $z_i$ could be the social attitude towards drunk driving
in state $i$.

- If we define $\alpha_i = \beta_0 + \beta_2z_i$, then (1) simplifies to

    $$\begin{aligned}
    y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \beta_1x_{i,t} + u_{i,t} \end{aligned}$$

- The graphical interpretation of $\alpha_i$ is that it is the intercept
of the relationship between alcohol taxes and traffic fatalities in
state $i$.

- It is straightforward to allow for further variables which are constant
over time in (1).

- In this case the intercepts $\alpha_i$ reflect the combined effect of
several variables which are constant over time.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

- The key advantage of the fixed effects model is that it allows us to
control for all time invariant omitted variables.

- This is particularly important in the case of variables which are
difficult or impossible to observe.

- The key disadvantage is that we have to estimate a number of additional
parameters.

- Furthermore, it will be impossible to estimate the effect of variables
which do not (or hardly) vary over time.

## Time Fixed Effects

- The basic fixed effects model only prevents omitted variable bias from
variables that do not change over time.

- However, panel data allow us to control also for omitted variable bias
from one other type of omitted variable.

- In the traffic fatalities example technical progress could be an
important determinant of the number of deaths and could also be
correlated with alcohol taxes.

- At the same time this variable probably affects all states in the same
way (i.e. does not vary across states).

## Time and Unit Fixed Effects

- In most applications we use both unit and time fixed effects at the
same time.

- This model is sometimes referred to as the “twoway fixed effects” model.

- In the literature the cross-sectional fixed effects are referred to as
“fixed effects”, “state (fixed) effects”, “firm (fixed) effects” or
“person (fixed) effects”.

- Similarly, time fixed effects are often referred to as “time effects”.

# Violations of Assumptions

## Assumption 2 in Panel Data

- Panel data is characterized by time dependency for each panel unit.

- As discussed in Week 6, this is a violation of the regression Assumption
2 (X and Y are i.i.d).

### Serial Correlation

- Time dependency is often described as autocorrelation or serial correlation.

- The main approach to deal with serial correlation is by adjusting standard errors to take into account autocorrelation.

- If there is substantial autocorrelation (serial correlation) in the error term, even heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors will be inconsistent.

- In panel data as in any other time series data, autocorrelation can be a very serious concern.

- We can test for serial correlation after our fixed effects estimation using the Breusch-Godfrey test.

- The null hypothesis in this test is that the autocorrelation of the error term is 0.

### Cross-sectional dependence

- Cross-sectional dependence in panels may arise when e.g. countries respond to common shocks or if spatial diffusion processes are present (think Arab Spring, or shocks from the financial crisis).

- If cross-sectional dependence is present, this results, at least, in the inefficiency of the estimators and invalid inference when using standard estimation techniques.

- This is another instance of the violation of regression Assumption 2.

- If we assume that our earlier two-way fixed effects model specification is consistent, then we can test for residual cross-sectional dependence
after the introduction of two-way fixed effects to account for common shocks.

## Panel-corrected Standard Errors

- Panel-corrected standard errors (Beck and Katz 1995)

    - **panel heteroskedasticity**: each country may have its own error variance

    - **contemporaneous correlation of the errors**: the error for one country may be correlated with the errors for other countries in the same year

    - **serially correlated errors**: the errors for a given country are correlated with previous errors for that country

## General Approach to Correlation Between Panels

- Driscoll and Kraay (1998) propose an estimator producing heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation- consistent standard errors that are robust to general forms of spatial and temporal dependence. Often known as the SCC estimator.

- Panel Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE), while popular in political science, may not work well with shorter panels with large N (ratio of T/N is small).

- SCC estimator performs equally well in large N settings.

## Your Roadmap with Panel Data

- Is it a fixed effects or random effects model?

- Hausman test. But primarily the choice should be driven by theory!

- Use robust standard errors, start with HAC.

- Check whether there is any cross-sectional dependence:

- If not, you can stick to HAC.

- If you have cross-sectional dependence, you need to use PCSE or SCC (use SCC).
